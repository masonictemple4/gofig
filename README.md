### TODOs
- [ ] Still a little finicky with layout, need to test and fix that on both single and mutlipae windows..
- [ ] Refactor the Load layout function in tmux.
- [ ] Add an overall project config to house the tmux sessions as children so we can do it by project.
- [ ] Round out tests.
- [ ] Overall error handling..
